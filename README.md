## Tech Stack
StudySpot boasts a blend of various technologies:

- React (SPA): The user interface is a Single Page Application (SPA) crafted using React, offering dynamic updates and reduced page reloads for a seamless user experience.
- Jest: Employed as the testing framework for React.
- Go & Gin: Go, coupled with the Gin HTTP web framework, forms the backbone of the server-side logic.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Implemented for secure authentication and information exchange.
- PostgreSQL: Chosen for robust and reliable data storage.
- Docker & Docker-compose: Ensures consistent application behavior across various environments.
- AWS (Amazon Web Services): Provides a scalable and reliable platform for hosting the application and associated services.
- ECS Fargate & ECR: Used to run, manage, and store Docker containers.
- RDS: Powers our cloud-based PostgreSQL database.
- Terraform: Streamlines the provisioning process of our cloud infrastructure.
- GitHub Actions & CI/CD: Automates the development workflows, including testing and deployment.

## Getting Started
To have a local copy up and running, adhere to the following steps:

### Prerequisites
- Install Docker and Docker-compose.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/tkohei07/personal-project.git `

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd personal-project` 

3. Install the required npm packages:

`npm install` 

4. To initiate the application locally with Docker, execute:

`docker-compose up` 

This will spawn Docker containers for your application and start them.

## Testing
Run Frontend Test:

`docker-compose run --rm -e CI=true client sh -c "npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false"`

Run Backend Test:

`docker-compose run --rm server go test ./cmd/api/...`

`docker-compose run --rm server go test ./internal/repository/dbrepo/...`

On successful test execution, the workflow will display "Tests passed". If any test fails, it will report "Tests failed" and exit with a non-zero status.

## Deployment
The application is hosted on AWS, using a blend of ECS Fargate for running Docker containers, ECR for storing Docker images, and RDS for the PostgreSQL database. Infrastructure management and provisioning is accomplished via Terraform.
